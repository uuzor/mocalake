MocaLake - Identity-First Approach (No Custom Smart Contracts):
Core Realization:

Tickets = AIR Kit Credentials (not NFTs)
Anti-scalping = Identity verification (not contract logic)
Fan verification = AIR Kit schemas (not custom tokens)

How It Actually Works:
1. Event Tickets as Verifiable Credentials
javascript// Event organizer issues ticket credentials
const ticketCredential = await airService.issueCredential({
  authToken: organizerJWT,
  issuerDid: organizerDID,
  credentialId: "event_ticket_program",
  credentialSubject: {
    eventName: "Taylor Swift Concert",
    eventDate: "2024-12-01",
    ticketType: "VIP",
    seatSection: "A1",
    purchasePrice: "150",
    originalBuyer: userDID,
    transferable: false // Anti-scalping built-in
  }
});
2. Fan Status as Credentials
javascript// Fans earn verifiable credentials over time
const fanCredential = await airService.issueCredential({
  credentialSubject: {
    artistName: "Taylor Swift",
    attendanceCount: 5,
    memberSince: "2020",
    spendingTier: "superfan",
    verified: true
  }
});
3. Entry Verification (Zero Smart Contracts)
javascript// At venue entrance
const entryVerification = await airService.verifyCredential({
  authToken: venueJWT,
  programId: "event_entry_program"
});

if (entryVerification.status === "Compliant") {
  // Allow entry - person has valid ticket credential
}
Anti-Scalping Through Identity:

Tickets are non-transferable credentials linked to identity
Resales require identity verification and price caps
ZK proofs let you prove ticket ownership without revealing personal data

Why This Approach Wins:

No gas fees for users (AIR Kit sponsored)
No complex contracts to audit or deploy
Privacy-preserving through ZK proofs
Cross-platform - credentials work everywhere
Focuses on the hackathon theme: identity infrastructure

The smart contract I wrote completely defeats the purpose. MocaLake should be a pure identity play leveraging AIR Kit's infrastructure, not recreating traditional NFT marketplaces.
Want me to redesign this as a credential-based system using only AIR Kit?RetryEVnow which schema are we going to create, check the chaina again for referenceEditLooking back at the conversation and the schema examples in the AIR Kit documentation, I can see we need to create schemas that align with MocaLake's fan verification and ticketing system.
Based on the provided examples (Membership Points, Age Verification, Event Pass, Professional Credential), here are the two core schemas MocaLake needs:
1. Fan Verification Credential Schema
Purpose: Prove fan status and tier without revealing personal data
json{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "fanId": "string",
    "artistName": "string", 
    "fanTier": "enum: [casual, verified, superfan, vip]",
    "attendanceCount": "integer",
    "memberSince": "date",
    "totalSpent": "string", // In ranges like "$100-500" for privacy
    "verificationLevel": "enum: [basic, kyc_verified, premium]",
    "lastActivity": "date"
  }
}
2. Event Ticket Credential Schema
Purpose: Non-transferable ticket that prevents scalping
json{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "ticketId": "string",
    "eventName": "string",
    "artistName": "string",
    "eventDate": "dateTime",
    "venue": "string",
    "ticketType": "enum: [general, vip, backstage, premium]",
    "seatInfo": "string",
    "purchasePrice": "string",
    "originalBuyer": "string", // DID
    "transferable": "boolean", // Always false for anti-scalping
    "purchaseTimestamp": "dateTime",
    "validUntil": "dateTime"
  }
}
Key Design Decisions:
Privacy-First:

totalSpent uses ranges instead of exact amounts
attendanceCount without revealing specific events
Fan status provable via ZK without exposing purchase history

Anti-Scalping Built-In:

transferable: false in ticket credentials
originalBuyer linked to identity
Tickets expire after event

Cross-Platform Reputation:

Fan credentials work across all artists/venues
Portable fan tier that travels with identity
Attendance history builds over time

These schemas leverage AIR Kit's existing patterns while solving the core problems: proving fan status privately and preventing ticket scalping through identity verification rather than complex smart contracts.
The beauty is that event organizers become credential issuers and venues become credential verifiers - no custom contracts needed.RetryEVthere are 2 types of schema ld and json - A comprehensive example showing how to create a schema for tracking membership points and tiers.

}EditYou're absolutely right. I need to create both the JSON-LD Context and JSON Schema for each credential type. Let me create the complete schemas for MocaLake following the AIR Kit format:MocaLake Fan Verification Credential SchemaCode {
  "fanCredentialJsonLD": {
    "@context": [
      {
        "@version": 1.1,

        "type": "@type",
        "EventTicketCredential": {
          "@id": "https://mocalake.com/schemas/event-tickePerfect! I've created both complete schemas for MocaLake following the AIR Kit format. Here's what we have:
Schema 1: Fan Verification Credential
Key Features:

Privacy-preserving spending tiers ($0-100, $100-500, etc.) instead of exact amounts
Reputation scoring (0-1000) for behavioral tracking
Multiple verification levels (basic, KYC verified, premium)
Cross-artist portability - fan status travels everywhere

Schema 2: Event Ticket Credential
Key Features:

Anti-scalping by design - transferable: false by default
Identity-linked via originalBuyer DID
Price protection with maxResalePrice built-in
Usage tracking with isUsed flag
Automatic expiration via validUntil

How These Work Together:
Fan Journey:

Get verified → Receive FanVerificationCredential
Buy tickets → Receive EventTicketCredential (linked to fan identity)
Attend events → Build reputation and attendance count
Unlock perks → Higher tiers get early access, better prices

Anti-Scalping Flow:

Tickets are non-transferable credentials by default
If resale allowed, price cap enforced via maxResalePrice
Identity verification required for any transfer
Reputation penalties for scalping attempts

These schemas eliminate the need for complex smart contracts - everything is handled through AIR Kit's credential issuance and verification system. Event organizers become credential issuers, venues become verifiers, and fans build portable reputation across the entire ecosystem.
